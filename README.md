# Python-Based-Message-Encoder-Decoder

Encode-Decode Tool

This is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library that allows users to encode and decode messages using a specified key. The encoding and decoding are performed using a custom algorithm and base64 encoding for secure and reversible transformations.

-> Features:
1. Encode and Decode: You can use this tool to encode a message with a secret key or decode an encoded message with the same key.
2. User-friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy for users to input the message, key, and choose the mode of operation.
3. Secure Encoding: The tool uses a secure encoding algorithm, making it suitable for encoding sensitive information.

-> Instructions:
1. Message Input: Enter the message you want to encode or decode in the 'MESSAGE' field.
2. Key Input: Provide a key for encoding or decoding in the 'KEY' field.
3. Mode Selection: Specify the mode of operation using 'e' for encoding or 'd' for decoding in the 'MODE(e-encode, d-decode)' field.
4. Result Display: The result of the operation will be displayed in the 'RESULT' field.
5. RESULT Button: Click the 'RESULT' button to perform the encoding or decoding based on the provided inputs.
6. RESET Button: To clear all input fields and results, click the 'RESET' button.
7. EXIT Button: Close the application by clicking the 'EXIT' button.

-> Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using python encode_decode_tool.py in the terminal.
